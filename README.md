## Bloccit: a Reddit replica to teach the fundamentals of web development and Rails.

Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).
This was my first Rails application where I learned how to use Rails MVC structure to build a
Reddit replica.
## Versions
This application uses version 2.2.3 of Ruby, 4.2 of Rails

## Gems and Dependencies
Devise 3.4.0 was used. The latest versions of bootstrap-sass, binding_of_caller. pundit, and pry-rails, pundit, mini_magick, and carrierwave were used. Will_paginate version 3.0.5 was used.

## Testing
In this project MiniTest has been discarded and Rspec is used.
